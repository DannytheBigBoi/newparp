        <p>This is MSPARP's new roulette feature. If you want to use filters to select which characters you connect to, you can still do so with <a href="{{url_for("home", mode="search")}}">character search</a>. Otherwise, you can select your character (it's optional) and click Enter. You'll be randomly matched with another user but both of you will appear anonymously to each other.</p>
